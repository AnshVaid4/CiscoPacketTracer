Shutdown the ports of switches: config t > interface range fa0/1-24  > shutdown
Re-enable: config t > interface range fa0/6, fa0/11, fa0/18  > switchport mode access 

>>Creating a vlan
config t > vlan [any name] > name [any name/purpose]

`After this step the vlan with your initialized name will be created but still all the ports on switch are the part of vlan1`

>>Check status of created vlan ids
show vlan brief

`Now the task is to assign switch ports to the created VLANs`
config t > interface range fa0/6-10 > switchport access vlan [id]		(switchport access vlan [id] command gives that port the access of vlan id provided in the command)

`This changes the ports from vlan1 to the specified vlan id`
show vlan id [id]

VLAN Name                             Status    Ports
---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
10   faculty/staff                    active    Fa0/11, Fa0/12, Fa0/13, Fa0/14
                                                Fa0/15, Fa0/16, Fa0/17

`Now create a trunk so that the switches share the details about vlan amongst themselves`	[this also brings connection between switches up]
config t > interface range fa0/1-5  > switchport mode trunk > switchport trunk native vlan 99 > no shutdown
